## Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges

Office 365 requires connectivity to the Internet. The endpoints below should be reachable for customers using Office 365 plans, including Government Community Cloud (GCC).

Start with Managing Office 365 endpoints to understand our recommendations for managing network connectivity using this data. Endpoints data is updated at the beginning of each month with new IP Addresses and URLs published 30 days in advance of being active. This allows for customers who do not yet have automated updates to complete their processes before new connectivity is required. Endpoints may also be updated during the month if needed to address support escalations, security incidents, or other immediate operational requirements. The data shown on this page below is all generated from the REST-based web services. If you are using a script or a network device to access this data, you should go to the Web service directly.

Endpoint data below lists requirements for connectivity from a user's machine to Office 365. It does not include network connections from Microsoft into a customer network, sometimes called hybrid or inbound network connections. See Additional endpoints for more information.

The endpoints are grouped into four service areas. The first three service areas can be independently selected for connectivity. The fourth service area is a common dependency (called Microsoft 365 Common and Office) and must always have network connectivity.
